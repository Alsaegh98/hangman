Hangman game idea

There will be a set of letters from A to Z. The goal is to guess a secret word by suggesting letters one at a time. If you choose a wrong letter the game will draw a stick man. First the head which is a circle(o), second (I) which is the body. Then the 2 arms then 2 legs. So, you will have 6 guesses. Once you finish those 6 guesses You lost. If you guessed right the letter will be added to the word selector wether its in the beginning or middle or the end.



User stories

. As a user, I want to see a landing page when I arrive at the website to know I'm in the right place.

. As a user, I want to see a clear dashs that needs to show me how many letters are there and how many I got right and how many letters left for me to choose or guess.
. As a user, I want to see a display of the stick man once I get a wrong guess.

Pseudo Code

Once I enter the page there will be a hanger on the left, a keyboard that has the lost of letters, and the dashes that contains the letters of the word. 

When the game start a word will be selected and it will be shown as in dashes. Let’s say the word is cat. So there will be (_ _ _). So I’ll start by clicking on the letter that is selected. Let’s say I clicked on (A). The display will be (_A_). if I choose a wrong letter like E. Then a circle will be added to the hanger as in the first mistake. This will continue until I get a stickman which is head(O), body (I), 2 hands (—),(—), and 2 legs(/)(\) which is 6 guesses. If I finished the 6 guesses and I didn’t get the word that means I lost. But, if I got the full word without finishing the guesses that means I won. Once I click on a letter I can’t choose this letter again.
