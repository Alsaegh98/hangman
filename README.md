## hangman

game idea

There will be a set of letters from A to Z. The goal is to guess a secret word by suggesting letters one at a time. If you choose a wrong letter the game will draw a stick man. First the head which is a circle(o), second (I) which is the body. Then the 2 arms then 2 legs. So, you will have 6 guesses. Once you finish those 6 guesses You lost. If you guessed right the letter will be added to the word selector wether its in the beginning or middle or the end.
